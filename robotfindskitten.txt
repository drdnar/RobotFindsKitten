|                                                     |
|  You all know the score. You're working on a hard   |   
|  problem for math class. You're using y=, 2nd+      |
|  calc+whatever, fnInt( . And you desperately need   |
|  to know one thing: where are the Zen simulations   |
|  on your calculator?                                |
|                                                     |
|  Look no further. robotfindskitten is in fact a Zen |
|  simulation. And it's for the TI-83+. And the 84+.  |
|  And Linux. And the PalmOS. And the Sega Dreamcast. |
|  And your Web Browser. And an empty pop can. The    |
|  application of this to the previous sentence is    |
|  left as an exercise for the reader.                |

|  History of robotfindskitten                        |              
|                                                     |              
|  P. A. Peterson II originally stumbled across the   |              
|  contest concept 'robotfindskitten' when perusing   |              
|  Jake Berendes' web pages in 1996, which he found   |              
|  via the Crupper Scupper Supper Upper and the       |              
|  Flupperdupper Maleatora's early vision into        |              
|  search-engine (and Web- Counter(tm)) tom-foolery.  |              
|  Not led by the promise of porn, but instead by the |              
|  10k-per-day hits their site got in 1996.           |              
|  Jake had a contest for his friends called          |              
|  "robotfindskitten", wherein they would submit      |              
|  pictures depicting, well, robotfindskitten.        |              
|                                                     |              
|  Apparently not too many people submitted.          |              
|                                                     |              
|  Well, ok, two people submitted, but both of those  |              
|  were drawings of a robot obliterating a kitten in  |              
|  some way. kitten remained unfound.                 |              
|                                                     |              
|  Later, Peterson started "Nerth Pork", a            |              
|  now-defunct webzine for the output of some good    |              
|  stuff and a also a quite a lot of crap. Peterson   |              
|  thought that moving the "robotfindskitten" contest |              
|  to Nerth Pork would be useful, fun, and might      |              
|  attract submissions.                               |              
|                                                     |              
|  It didn't.                 #                       |              
|                                                     |              
|  Well, not many.                                    |              
|                                                     |              
|  Leonard Richardson (of Crummy and segfault.org     |              
|  fame) originally wrote "robotfindskitten" for DOS  |              
|  in 1997 as his submission to the robotfindskitten  |              
|  contest. It won first prize (the fact that there   |              
|  were no other entrants may have had something to   |              
|  do with it).                                       |              
|                                                     |              
|  In 1999, Richardson decided to rewrite             |              
|  robotfindskitten for everyone's favorite operating |              
|  system called Linux: Linux! Almost two years       |              
|  later, robotfindskitten was rediscovered by        |              
|  a bunch of free-software lunatics who thought that |              
|  rfk love needed to be spread around.               |              
|                                                     |             
|  Hilarity ensued.                                   |              
|                                                     |              
|  Actually, everyone found great fulfillment in the  |              
|  simulatedly being robot, finding kitten, and so    |              
|  they decided that robotfindskitten needed to be    |              
|  brought to the rest of the world.                  |              
|                                                     |              
|  And then came a PalmOS port. And then a CGI. And   |              
|  then Dreamcast. And then GameBoy. And then         |              
|  someone wrote robotfindskitten for an empty pop    |              
|  can... you get the idea, and the rest...           |              
|                                                     |              
|  ...is history.                                     |              
|                                                     |              
|  Yet to be written.                                 |              
|                                                     |

|  robotfindskitten for Your Calculator               | 
|                                                     | 
|  robotfindskitten is for the TI-84 Plus CE.  This   | 
|  version will not work on other models. However,    | 
|  there is a version for the TI-83+, TI-83+SE,       | 
|  TI-84+, and TI-84+SE, and also one for the TI-84   | 
|  Plus C SE.                                         |
|                                                     | 
|  robotfindskitten also requires a data appvar.      |
|  You may place this appvar in the archive or keep   |
|  it in RAM.                                         |
|                                                     | 
|  To run robotfindskitten, press 2nd+0 (zero), then  | 
|  select Asm( from the menu and press Enter. Then,   | 
|  select prgmRFK from the PRGM menu. The line of     |
|  text displayed should read Asm(prgmRFK . Press     | 
|  Enter to run the program.                          | 
|                                                     | 
|  The simulation itself should be pretty straight-   | 
|  forward. The game will briefly explain itself.     | 
|  Pressing any key on your calculator will start the | 
|  simulation. Use the arrow keys to move. It is also | 
|  possible to quit by pressing Clear, but you would  | 
|  never want to do that before finding kitten, would | 
|  you?                                               | 
|                                                     | 
|  If you see an error message saying that the        | 
|  RFKDATA appvar cannot be found, then make sure the | 
|  appvar named RFKDATA is on your calculator, and    | 
|  is not corrupted; try resending the file.          | 
|                                                     | 
|  robotfindskitten also supports reading the data    | 
|  file from an alternative appvar. To select this    | 
|  appvar, place the name of the appvar into Ans by   | 
|  typing in the name of the appvar in quotes,        | 
|  pressing enter (the name should appear on the      | 
|  screen as confirmation), and the running the       | 
|  program normally. Note that if the appvar is not   | 
|  found or corrupted, no error message will be       | 
|  presented if RFKDATA is found instead.             | 
|                                                     | 
|  To create your own data appvar, use the provided   | 
|  appvar creator. It is Windows-only.                | 
|  robotfindskitten uses specially compressed appvars | 
|  to reduce data file size, usually by about half.   | 
|  The program RfkHuffmanCoder takes a text file as   | 
|  its input. Each line of text contains the text for | 
|  a single non-kitten item. Text is limited to the   | 
|  96 basic printable ASCII characters due both to    | 
|  limits in the robotfindskitten font and mostly the | 
|  Huffman tree format. If you drag-and-drop a file   | 
|  onto the compressor, the output will always be     | 
|  named like the input. The command line option -n   | 
|  may be used to specify a different name.           | 
|                                                     | 
|  If you get an error message about the tree, this   | 
|  means that you need to adjust letter frequencies.  | 
|  To do so, use the command line option -g and enter | 
|  some random letters not containing a space. Rare   | 
|  letters like x, j, k, and q usually work best.     | 
|                                                     |

|  A FINAL THOUGHT                                    | 
|  ---------------                                    |
|                                                     |
|  "Day and night I feverishly worked upon the        |
|  machine, creating both a soul which could desire   |
|  its goal, and a body with which it could realize   |
|  it. Many who saw my creation called it an          |
|  abomination, and denied me grant money. But they   |
|  could not dissuade me from my impossible task. It  |
|  was a spectre that tormented me always, a ghost I  |
|  had to give a form and a life, lest it consume me  |
|  from the inside.  And when at last my task was     |
|  done, when the grey box on wheels was complete and |              
|  when it, as well as I, knew what had to be done, I |              
|  felt deep sympathy for the machine.  For I had not |              
|  destroyed the phantom, but merely exorcized it     |              
|  into another body. The robot knew not why this     |              
|  task had to be performed, for I could not imbue it |              
|  with knowledge I did not myself posess. And at the |              
|  same time, I felt a sweeping sense of relief sweep |              
|  over me, that somehow, the dream that had driven   |              
|  me for my entire life had come one step closer to  |              
|  fruition.  "As I vocally activated the robot, I    |              
|  realized that it was following my instructions,    |              
|  but not out of any desire to obey me. Had I        |              
|  remained silent, it would have performed           |              
|  exactly the same operations. We were two beings    |              
|  controlled by the same force now. And yet, seeking |              
|  vainly to hold some illusion of control over the   |              
|  machine I thought I had created, I gave my final   |              
|  command.                                           |

|  "`GO!' I told the box as it began to roll out of   |              
|  my workshop into the frozen desert beyond. `FIND   |
